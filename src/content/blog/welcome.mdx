# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I'm Mahmut Zahid Göksu, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about deep learning, research, and practical AI applications.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog serves as my digital space where I share:

- **Thoughts on Events**: My perspectives on tech conferences, industry developments, and significant moments in AI/ML
- **Paper Reviews**: In-depth analyses of recent research papers in machine learning
- **Technical Insights**: Practical learnings from my work and experiments

## Why I Started This Blog

As an ML engineer, I constantly consume research papers, experiment with new techniques, and think about the future of AI. This blog is a way to:

1. **Document my learning journey**
2. **Share knowledge with the community**
3. **Engage in meaningful discussions**

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for upcoming posts on:

- Recent advances in transformer architectures
- Practical tips for training large language models
- Reviews of groundbreaking papers in computer vision

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any topics!

## Example Code Block

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)

# Create model instance
model = SimpleModel(784, 256, 10)
print(f"Model parameters: {sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())}")
```

## Math Support

This blog supports LaTeX math rendering. Here's an example:

The softmax function is defined as:

$$
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{x_j}}
$$

And inline math works too: $E = mc^2$
